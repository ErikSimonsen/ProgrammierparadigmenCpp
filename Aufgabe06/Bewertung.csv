General;Your Evaluation;Max;Result;How to evaluate by yourself;;Your Comment, why you think your solution is also correct.;Answers Schmidt / Helmke
yes or no?;yes;3;3;Did you upload something before deadline to SVN and this approximates the expected solution (not just code which solves something completely different)?;;;
Are the correct files with correct file names in the correct folders? Otherwise heavy lose of points possible!!!;yes;1;1 ;The folder name is Aufgabe06  and the code is in folder Aufgabe06\Code and there exists a file Aufgabe06\Fertig.txt and there exist two files Aufgabe06\Bewertung.xlsx and  Aufgabe06\Bewertung.csv.;;;
Did you only upload the necessary files to SVN?;yes;1;1 ;Are your uploaded files all necessary? (no executables or object files etc. are uploaded)?;;;

Exercise 6-1;Your Evaluation;Max;Result;How to evaluate by yourself;;;
yes or no?;yes;1;1;Are all global variables replaced (static class variables are still allowed)?  Very few points, because not in eval criteria in pdf file.;;;

Exercise 6-2;Your Evaluation;Max;Result;How to evaluate by yourself;;;
yes or no?;yes;1;1;Did you replace all struct instances by classes? If you search for struct, you get no match (except in comments)?   Very few points, because not in eval criteria in pdf file.;;;
yes or no?;yes;1;1;All member attributes  are in private area of the classes and only accessible via Get-ter and Set-ter methods?   Very few points, because not in eval criteria in pdf file.;;;

yes or no?;yes;2;2;Are all the tests well documented in the beginning of the tests? It should be clear what the test is testing and when the output is true and when false.;;;
yes or no?;yes;2;2;Are all the tests independent from each other? The tests must be able to run in any order. They must clear the heap memory by themselves.;;;

The following you can only evaluate, when you have finally checked in your code. Then you get the final evaluation criteria.;;;;;;;
yes or no?;yes;7;7;Stress Test: Put your tests in a loop and call them all again and again, they should have at least 60 seconds of runtime. The system should not crash. This should show that you have no memory leaks.  Is the program still stable and the program does not crash?;;Hhe: Criteria will be updated;siehe Feedback, könnte man geschickter machen, zu viele Ausgaben
yes or no?;yes;1;1;Is the file StressTestLoop.jpg uploaded to SVN Images folder, which shows a screen dump of your code, in which all your tests run in a loop?;;Hhe: Criteria will be updated;
